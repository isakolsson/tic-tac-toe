# Tic-Tac-Toe vs Minimax Alghorithm
This web application allows you to play tic-tac-toe vs the computer who uses a [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves) to deciede which square to place in in order to get the best possible outcome. In short, it goes through every possible outcome of the game to decide which square is the best. It will always assume you are going to place perfect when it's your turn and that the program is going to play perfectly when it is its turn.

All the delays are artificial, there's no problem looping through all the possible outcomes of the game and see if there is a winner or a draw on a low-end device within a few milliseconds.
